# Assignment 1 - Report

**Student Name: Molly Sheppard**

## 1.1 Proto Personas

### Persona 1

 ** Shannon Borgle **

Shannon, age 42, is a receptionist at her local hospice in Liverpool, working 4.5hrs every weekday. She still lives with her parents and has remained single since she dropped out of school at 14 to try to pursue a hair and makeup business. She prefers gossiping with her colleagues than assisting the general public and is always in trouble with her boss. Her gossip often revolves around her obsessive love for Leonardo DiCaprio where she uses FlickFinder to explore more of his movies to aid her obsession. 

### Persona 2

** James Sharpe **

James, age 28, is a instagram content-creator from Hackney, London. Growing up, both his parents worked full time jobs at The Royal London Hospital which left James alone often after school to watch various movies. After studying journalism at the University of Southampton, he moved back to Hackney to pursue a self-employed social media career sharing his love for film. He often uses FlickFinder to find information about the movies he plans to watch to be able to share them with his followers. 

## 1.2 Scenario

** Helping Shannon watch all of DiCaprio's movies **

Shannon is a hospice receptionist in Liverpool. Whilst she only works part time, she often slacks off from her work by prioritising her interests in hair and makeup and her obsession with the actor Leonardo DiCaprio. 

She needs a useful site that can allow her to list all movies by a specific actor so that she can go through the list and watch all of DiCaprio's movies. As Shannon finds technology a little difficult to use, her family recommended her to use FlickFinder as it has a simplistic graphic for her to understand and a "search movies by star" feature where she could find a long list of movies starring Leonardo DiCaprio (id 138).

She uses these features, along with the view by ratings feature, to provide a list of top-rated Leonardo Dicaprio movies to work through in her free time. However, she would like a way to track her movies that she has watched already as well as a recommendation for her next movies to watch to further improve her experience with the site.
